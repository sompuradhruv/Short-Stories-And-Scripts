Here’s your host Mike… live in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Good Morning Mumbai, How are you and how's it going? Are you in your car? Imagine commuting to work in 2021. haha.
It's 8 in the morning and I am your host RJ Avinash, reporting from your favourite Radio station 98.2 FM.
Today we will talk about a topic everyone loves to hate. A topic that we all love to gossip about- BOLLYWOOD.
We had a new song last week called "Beyonce Sharma Jayegi" for the film "Kaali Peeli" and it recieved a lot of backlash for having the name "Beyonce" in the lyrics. 
For people who don't know, beyonce is basically a glorified version of Shreya Ghoshal. Beyonce fans, this joke was for you to get offended over.
Anyways, the producers decided to change the name of the song and even changed the lyrics but still ended up with 2 lakh dislikes. 
It's like changing your ipl team name and still losing in the finals.
But let's just talk about songs in general. Back in my days, this is in the 90s by the way I am not that old, we had songs that resonated with people. 
Good melodies about how we feel. 90% of the time they were about love but isn't almost every single song a love song in bollywood?
But nowadays the songs that we have are just the remixes of the good old melodies we had in the 90s. 
I say, where is the creativity? There are so many creative people in India, I mean just look at me. Why not.. why not give these people a chance?
Anyways it's time to say goodbye now. I, your favourite host RJ Avinash bid thee farewell. 
Will meet you tommorrow at the same time, on the same station. Until then here's a song for you by our sponsors called "Duniya Sharma Jayegi" from the film "Kaali Peeli".
